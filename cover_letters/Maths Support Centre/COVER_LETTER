Dear Sir or Madam,

I think I am very suitable for being a PG Demonstrator in Maths. The reason are as follow:

(a) I got a bachelor and Master degree in Electronics in which I took courses in  Linear Algebra, Calculus, Time-domain and frequency domain analysis, Signal Processing to mention but a few. 

(b) I got 7 years of experience as a teacher in different Universities in Mexico in Engineering
I taught subjects in Statistics, Stochastic Process, Digital Filters, Euclidean Geometry. 

(c) I both understand and know how a treat students in a friendly way in order to guide them and help them to find the answer on their own.

Although, my mother language is Spanish. I am pushing myself to improve my English language skills by participating in the poster conferences, going to writing workshops, writing papers, giving presentation of my research advances, developing a workshop to teach Robotics to children.

I am going to be so happy to be selected as a PG Demonstrator in Maths.

Yours faithfully,
Miguel Xochicale.

As second year PhD student in Human-Robot Interaction, 
 

We are also particularly keen to recruit postgraduates who demonstrate a willingness to work in the centre in subsequent academic years, and who are willing to mentor or share their experience with new tutors as they are recruited.


 The activity involves working with individual 
or possibly small groups of students,
 to help them understand and tackle the specific mathematical problems they might encounter.  

Providing mathematics support is not about ‘telling’ the student the answer, 
but more about encouraging them to identify their own mathematical problems, helping them tackle these for themselves with your support and guidance, 
providing suggestions for independent study, 
and directing them to other appropriate learning materials.


1. A degree in a discipline with a significant mathematical or statistical component [Essential].
2. Excellent communication skills – both written and verbal [Essential].
3. Excellent interpersonal skills, including a friendly and approachable manner, and the ability to work with students from a range of disciplines and with a range of mathematical abilities [Essential].
4. Experience of working as part of a team [Desirable].
5. Previous Experience of teaching, tutoring or helping others learn mathematics or statistics [Desirable].

If you are interested in becoming a postgraduate tutor within the mathematics support centre, please apply by 2pm on Friday 23 September 2016, providing a CV and covering letter, including a brief summary of how you meet the knowledge, skills and experience required for the role.
