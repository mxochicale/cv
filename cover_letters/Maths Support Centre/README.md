Job Description
Postgraduate Opportunity: Tutoring in the University of Birmingham Mathematics Support Centre

Respond by: 2pm on Friday 23 September 2016

About the Centre
Mathematics and statistics are relevant to many discipline areas, however, many students experience difficulties with these subjects as they begin their university studies.  The University of Birmingham has a university-wide mathematics support centre where all students can receive additional help with the mathematical and statistical content of their courses. 

Students are able to drop-in to the mathematics support centre anytime during its hours of opening and receive one-to-one help with any mathematics or statistics based problem; there is no need for them to make an appointment.  This drop-in support is particularly targeted at first-year undergraduate students from all disciplines and programmes of study within the University, and at students from other year groups identified as having particular difficulties with basic mathematical and statistical techniques.

The Centre is based within the Academic Skills Centre in the Library and is open to students during term time between the hours of 1000 – 1600, Monday to Friday.

I’m a Postgraduate Student - What is the Opportunity?
The mathematics support centre is staffed by postgraduate students who provide one-to-one mathematics and statistics support to undergraduate students who drop-in.  It is expected two postgraduate students will be available at all times within the centre during its opening hours.

The Centre is therefore looking for 6 - 10 first or second year PhD students to work as tutors within the Centre for the 2016/2017 academic year.   We would like to recruit postgraduates from across the University as we wish to ensure the centre is able to offer a discipline based focus at particular times.

We are also particularly keen to recruit postgraduates who demonstrate a willingness to work in the centre in subsequent academic years, and who are willing to mentor or share their experience with new tutors as they are recruited.

 

Qualifications
What knowledge, skills and experience do I need?
Working in a mathematics support centre is different to other forms of postgraduate teaching or demonstrating that you might be involved with.  The activity involves working with individual or possibly small groups of students, to help them understand and tackle the specific mathematical problems they might encounter.  Providing mathematics support is not about ‘telling’ the student the answer, but more about encouraging them to identify their own mathematical problems, helping them tackle these for themselves with your support and guidance, providing suggestions for independent study, and directing them to other appropriate learning materials.

We would therefore expect postgraduate students who work in the Centre to have the following skills and abilities:

1. A degree in a discipline with a significant mathematical or statistical component [Essential].
2. Excellent communication skills – both written and verbal [Essential].
3. Excellent interpersonal skills, including a friendly and approachable manner, and the ability to work with students from a range of disciplines and with a range of mathematical abilities [Essential].
4. Experience of working as part of a team [Desirable].
5. Previous Experience of teaching, tutoring or helping others learn mathematics or statistics [Desirable].

What will I get in Return?
Postgraduate students who work in the centre will receive payment at the current postgraduate demonstrating rate (currently £14.81per hour). The posts are offered on a casual contract, and weekly hours will vary over the course of the academic year.  All tutors are, however, expected to demonstrate a commitment to some timetabled tutoring of at least 3 hours each week. 

All new postgraduate tutors will receive training/guidance in advance of working in the centre. You will also be allocated a mentor who will help, advise and support you throughout your time working in the Centre.

By working in the Centre you will also further develop your own range of skills, and acquire valuable experience that will greatly enhance your future employment prospects within academia, business or industry.

Working Hours
How do I apply?
If you are interested in becoming a postgraduate tutor within the mathematics support centre, please apply by 2pm on Friday 23 September 2016, providing a CV and covering letter, including a brief summary of how you meet the knowledge, skills and experience required for the role.

An informal discussion will be held for shortlisted applicants on a date to be determined.

For informal queries in advance, or to discuss this opportunity further, please contact Michael Grove (m.j.grove@bham.ac.uk).
