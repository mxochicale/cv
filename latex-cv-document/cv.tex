\begin{description}
%\begin{description}[align=right,labelwidth=3cm]
\item [Personal Statement] 
I am always pushing myself to be at the last known barrier of knowledge.
I am a propositive, independent, curious and very stubborn person.
My mission in life is to contribute with machines and algorithms 
that are able to have better understanding of their surrounding and 
therefore be able to help other people and to create better world conditions.

\item [Research Interests]
I am interested in the fields of Human-Robot Interaction and Human Activity Recognition.
My scientific mission is to intuitively understand and to apply tools from nonlinear dynamics, 
chaos theory and deep learning in order to perform automatic quantification of variability in 
different contexts.

\section{Professional Experience}

\cventry{02/2013 -- 08/2013}{Research Assistant}{INAOE's Robotics Laboratory}{M\'exico}{}
{Achievements: I developed a Human-Robot Interaction Demo for dancing activities based on 
a Patrolbot mobile robot and a ZSTAR3 Radio Frequency single three-axial accelerometer.
For the demo, I explored four hand gestures where user's worn the accelerometer at his/her 
left wrist in order to create simple dance activities with the mobile robot
\href{https://sites.google.com/site/perezxochicale/projects/demodance}{\faExternalLink}.
}

\cventry{01/2012 -- 01/2013}{Invited Lecturer}
{Universidad Madero}{Puebla, M\'exico}{}
{Achievements:
I proposed and supervised the following students' projects: Haptic Referee Glove,
 Lightmetre and Pychometre using Arduino, Smart Irrigation, Persistent Of Vision Bicycle Wheel
 and a Delta Robot Structure 
\href{https://sites.google.com/site/perezxochicaleprojects/studentprojects}{\faExternalLink}.
Additionally, I proposed and designed a Mechatronic Laboratory which includes: 
(i) a benchmark for laboratories in mechatronics in M\'exico and Puebla, 
(ii) a 3D layout design and 
(iii) minimal requirements of hardware and software for the laboratory
 \href{https://sites.google.com/site/perezxochicaleprojects/mechatronicslaboratorydesign}{\faExternalLink}.
}

\cventry{09/2003 -- 03/2004}{Research Internship}
{INAOE}{M\'exico}{}
{Achievements:
I implemented a speed control for a two-degree-of-freedom robot with microcontrollers
PIC 16F84 and 16F877 that made communication via RS-232 using Virtual Instruments on LabVIEW.}
