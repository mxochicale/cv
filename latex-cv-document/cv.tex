\section{Research Interests}
\begin{changemargin}{2.4cm}{0.5cm}
I am interested in the fields of Human-Robot Interaction and Human Activity Recognition.
As a doctoral researcher I am gaining deeper understanding of the variability
of human movements using Non-linear Dynamics and Deep Learning Algorithms
in order to create novel analysis and interpretation of signals
collected through a network of Inertial Measurement Units.

\section{Professional Experience}

\cventry{02/2013 -- 08/2013}{Research Assistant}{INAOE's Robotics Laboratory}{M\'exico}{}
{Detailed achievements: I develop a Human-Robot Interaction Demo Dance which  was based on a ZSTAR3 Radio
Frequency single three-axis accelerometer and a Patrolbot mobile robot.
For the demo, I explored four gestures wearing the accelerometer in the left wrist
in order to create simple dance activities with the Patrolbot mobile robot.
For further information go to \href{https://sites.google.com/site/perezxochicale/projects/demodance}{\faExternalLink}.}

\cventry{01/2012 -- 01/2013}{Invited Lecturer}
{Universidad Madero}{Puebla, M\'exico}{}
{Detailed achievements:
I proposed and supervised the following students' projects: Haptic Referee Glove,
 Lightmetre and Pychometre using Arduino, Smart Irrigation, Persistent Of Vision Bicycle Wheel
 and a Delta Robot Structure.
\href{https://sites.google.com/site/perezxochicaleprojects/studentprojects}{\faExternalLink}
Additionally, I proposed and designed a Mechatronic Laboratory which includes a benchmark for
Mechatronic's laboratories in M\'exico and Puebla, a 3D layout design and minimal
requirements of hardware and software for the laboratory.
