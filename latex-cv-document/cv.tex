\section{Personal statement}

\begin{changemargin}{2.4cm}{0.5cm}
My background includes electronics, mechatronics, signal processing,  
and human-robot interaction.
I am a highly motivated and very determined person who aspires  
to understand and to apply tools from nonlinear dynamics and deep learning 
in the context of well-being.
Principles of hard work, responsibility, collaborative work, 
scientific integrity, and human kindness have guided me in all my life decisions.

\section{Professional Experience}

\cventry{02/2013 -- 08/2013}{Research Assistant in Robotics}{INAOE's Robotics Laboratory}{M\'exico}{}
{Achievements: I developed a Human-Robot Interaction Demo for dancing activities based on 
a Patrolbot mobile robot and a ZSTAR3 Radio Frequency single three-axial accelerometer.
For the demo, I explored four hand gestures where the user worn the accelerometer at his/her 
left wrist in order to create simple dance activities with the mobile robot. 
\href{https://sites.google.com/site/perezxochicale/projects/demodance}{(Documents and code: \faExternalLink)}.
}

\cventry{01/2012 -- 01/2013}{Lecturer in Mechatronic Engineering}
{Universidad Madero}{Puebla, M\'exico}{}
{Achievements:
I proposed and supervised the following students' projects: Haptic Referee Glove,
 Lightmetre and Pychometre using Arduino, Smart Irrigation, Persistent Of Vision Bicycle Wheel
 and a Delta Robot Structure 
\href{https://sites.google.com/site/perezxochicaleprojects/studentprojects}{(Project descriptions and code: \faExternalLink)}.
Additionally, I proposed and designed a Mechatronic Laboratory which includes: 
(i) a benchmark for laboratories in mechatronics in M\'exico and Puebla, 
(ii) a 3D layout design and 
(iii) minimal requirements of hardware and software for the laboratory
 \href{https://sites.google.com/site/perezxochicaleprojects/mechatronicslaboratorydesign}{(Document, slides and layout: \faExternalLink)}.
}

\cventry{09/2003 -- 03/2004}{Research Internship in Robotics}
{INAOE}{M\'exico}{}
{Achievements:
I implemented a speed control for a two-degree-of-freedom robot with microcontrollers
PIC 16F84 and 16F877 that made communication via RS-232 using Virtual Instruments on LabVIEW.}
